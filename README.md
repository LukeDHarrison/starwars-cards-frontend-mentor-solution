## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS Variables

### Continued development

The card button text colour changes on hover to match the cards background. This has resulted in some verbose CSS. I am sure there is a better way to achieve this with some fancy modern CSS selectors

### Useful resources
